This Service is operated by Abyss ("Abyss"). Abyss is also referred to in these Terms as "we", "our", and "us". 

By using our Service, you agree to be bound by Section I of these Terms ("General Terms"), which contains provisions applicable to all users of our Service, including visitors to the Abyss website (the "Site").

Our mission is to give people the power to build community and bring the world closer together. To help artist in expressing their works.  

    <span class="sub-TOS">Provide a personalized experience for you:</span>
    Your experience on Abyss is unlike anyone else's: from the Abyssals and Status Update and other content you see in Posts. We 
    use the data we have - for example, about the connections you make, the choices and settings you select, and what you 
    share and do on and off our Products - to personalize your experience.

    We help you find and connect with people, groups, businesses, organizations, and others that matter to you across Abyss. 
    Send a message to, deal with your abyssal and people you may want to become friends with. Stronger ties make for better
    communities, and we believe our services are most useful when people are connected to people, groups, and organizations 
    they care about. 

    <span class="sub-TOS">Empower you to express yourself and communicate about what matters to you:</span>
    There are many ways to express yourself on Abyss and to communicate with friends, family, and others about what matters 
    to you - for example, sharing status updates, photos, videos, and your artworks, sending messages to a friend or several 
    people or adding content to your profile.  

    <span class="sub-TOS">Help you discover content, products, and services that may interest you:  </span>
    We show you different topics depending on your interest to discover content, products or services offered by other Abyssians
